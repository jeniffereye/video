The Canada vs United States live stream serves up the dream NHL 4 Nations Face-Off final tonight, just five days after the arch-rivals' feisty round-robin phase skirmish

Their Saturday encounter saw three fights break out within the opening 10 seconds, both sides clearly revved-up by events off the field, before Connor McDavid broke the deadlock in spectacular fashion.

Recognizing the ebb and flow of the game, Mike Sullivan instructed his men to shut up shop, a tactical tweak that paid off handsomely. The U.S. ran out 3-1 winners, courtesy of a Jake Guentzel brace either side of a Dylan Larkin goal.

Canada had no answer for Matthew and Brady Tkachuk at the weekend, but the return of Cale Makar should have a huge impact in the Championship game. When Sidney Crosby pulls on that Canada jersey he always delivers, and TD Garden will provide all the incentive he needs.

Team USA and Canada will square off once again in the 4 Nations Face-Off final on Thursday, and if it's even half as good as their last tilt, hockey fans are in for a treat. The Americans won a heated battle Saturday, and the Canadians will be looking for revenge in the championship game.

In the round-robin matchup between these teams, the first true best-on-best meeting since 2016, the rivalry picked up where it left off and then some. After the Bell Centre crowd booed the U.S. national anthem, three fights took place over the first nine seconds. It was a raucous atmosphere, and we should expect more of the same Thursday in Boson.

The Americans stepped up in a hostile environment and notched a 3-1 win over their rivals to the north. Dylan Larkin had the game-winning goal and Jake Guentzel found the back of the net twice. Connor McDavid scored the lone Canadian goal, and Connor Hellebuyck stopped the other 25 shots he faced.

Coming into the rematch, both teams will be missing some key players. Canada's blue line depth has already been tested in this tournament after it lost Vegas Golden Knights teammates Shea Theodore and Alex Pietrangelo. Theodore was injured in the team's opening game against Sweden, and Pietrangelo bowed out due to illness.

As if theyâ€™re chaotic clash on Saturday night was not enough, the United States and Canada will take to the ice one more time on Thursday night in the championship game of the 4 Nations Face-Off.

These two teams met in one of the craziest hockey games in recent memory this past weekend in Montreal. On top of three fights in the opening nine seconds of the game, the U.S. and Canada battled in a tightly contested matchup, with the Americans pulling out a 3-1 win, clinching a spot in the championship game.

Canada had to work a little harder to get to the final, needing a good start on Monday afternoon to beat Finland, 5-3. Both teams finished round-robin play with 2-1-0 records as the United States lost to Sweden on Monday night.

This will be the fourth time these two teams have met in a best-on-best final. Canada won the best-of-three series in the 1991 Canada Cup and the gold medal game at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The U.S. won in dramatic fashion in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey.
