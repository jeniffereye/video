Roma will host Porto in the second leg of the Europa League knockout stage playoffs at the Olimpico Stadium on Thursday.

These two teams played out a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the competition and will be going all out in this one to cement their place in the next round.

Francisco Moura helped Porto secure the equalizer in the first leg and it will be interesting to see their approach away from home.

Stadio Olimpico, Rome

The match will be played at the Olimpico Stadium on Thursday, with kick-off at 12.45 pm ET for fans in the US.

Claudio Ranieri will have to navigate this fixture without two key players from last week, as both Bryan Cristante and Alexis Saelemaekers are suspended.

Despite being substituted at halftime during Romaâ€™s weekend victory over Parma due to an ankle issue, Gianluca Mancini is expected to be available.

As for Porto, Marko GrujiÄ‡ and Martim Fernandes remain unavailable due to injury, while the team opted to rest several key players in their recent match against Farense.

FC Porto are in third place in the Liga Portugal standings and have been inconsistent this season. The away side edged Farense to an important 1-0 victory over the weekend and will need to take it up a notch in this fixture.

AS Roma, on the other hand, are in ninth place in the Serie A table and have struggled to make their mark this season. The Giallorossi defeated Parma by a 1-0 scoreline in their previous game and will look to achieve a similar result this week.

AS Roma have an impressive squad at their disposal but have flattered to deceive this season. The hosts have a poor record in this fixture and cannot afford another debacle on Thursday.

FC Porto can pack a punch on their day but also have issues to address ahead of this fixture. AS Roma have the home advantage and hold a slight upper hand going into this game.

The Italian side held their Portuguese counterparts to a draw in last week's opener but have lost all three prior ties between the clubs. This time, the winners will face either Athletic Bilbao or Roma's arch-rivals Lazio.

Despite taking the lead at Estadio do Dragao, Roma had to settle for a first-leg draw in Porto, following a fractious contest.

Making a rare raid into the opposition box, Zeki Celik started the scoring; however, after the hosts struck back through Francisco Moura, Roma midfielder Bryan Cristante was sent off and they then sat back.

The Giallorossi - who finished one point above their playoff rivals in the league phase - have a rich recent history in UEFA competition, as Conference League winners in 2022.

Having then reached the final and then semi-finals of Europe's second-tier tournament in successive seasons, they only sneaked through to this year's knockout rounds with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on the final matchday.

Nonetheless, a potential last-16 clash with city rivals Lazio is now possible for Claudio Ranieri's side, who have been revived since the veteran coach came in to save a campaign that started messily, with two sackings.

Nine games unbeaten in Serie A after Sunday's 1-0 win in Parma, the Rome-born boss has transformed their season: a total of 21 points from those nine fixtures is unmatched by any other team in Italy's top flight.

Before resuming their latest continental quest, Roma can also reflect on past feats: the capital club have won 13 of their last 16 Europa League home matches, including all of the last three without conceding.
